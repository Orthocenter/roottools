0. This method is for committers only.
1. Create a working copy that contains all branches (it's easier)
2. After committing to Developmental/, cd to ../Stable/RootTools_sdk3_generic/
3. Cherry-pick! Otherwise you will end up with lots of unwanted material:
3.1. List changes that you made in Developmental/ and wish to merge:
     svn log
3.2. Merge each one manually:
     svn merge -c <change number> ../../Developmental/RootTools_sdk3_generic
4. Resolve conflicts, if any:
   svn resolve --accept theirs-full -R .
5. Commit!
   svn commit

Yes, you may need to enter interactive conflict resolution mode.
That is, rather than accepting "theirs-full.". Good luck.
